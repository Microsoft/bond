# Test Certificates

These are test certificates that are used for Bond TLS tests. There is a root
certificate and two host certificates. The two host certificates are signed
by the root.

These certificates should not be trusted for *anything*. Their private keys
are public to all.

The password for all of these .pfx files is "bond".
